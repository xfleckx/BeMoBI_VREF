The SNEED package for Unity3D provides a toolkit for developing experimental setups in virtual environments with focus on navigation and orientation tasks.

# SNEED - Spatial Navigation Environment Editor
A framework for scientific experiments in virtual environments focusing navigation and orientation tasks based on Mazes.

## Features 

**This is a work in progress state!**

Current:

- Building homogenous mazes of different room dimensions
- Define paths within mazes
- Define object sets based on categories
- provide some utilities for developing spatial navigation and orientation tasks

Future:

- Generate mazes defined by different constraints
- create complex and heterogene mazes for more realistic spatial navigation tasks
